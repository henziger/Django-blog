						<p>This blog remains purely as a relic from the past. I will not
						actively write new content or read/accept new comments here.
						However, it is quite a hilarious experience to read the old posts,
						so let's enjoy this django blog for what it is instead of being
						sorry for what it isn't.</p>
						<p>If you wish to contact me, head over to <a href=
						"https://henziger.se">henziger.se</a> for ways to do so.</p>
						<p>All the best!<br>

						<h1><a href="/django/post/13/">My Thoughts on Django and
								DjangoGirls</a></h1>
						<p>Having completed the DjangoGirls tutorial, including extenstions
						and more, I must say that I like it.<br>
						Granted, this blog only uses the most basic stuff and there's near
						endless potential for improvements. However, I feel that Django is
						logical and easy to work with. The way of putting together models,
						views, urls and templates and mixing it up with some Django
						fairydust is a most joyful experience. I've not worked with many
						web frameworks before but I do have some encounters with Flask and
						right now I think I prefer Django. I'm not sure why, and I'm much
						too inexperienced to have a say in the matter, but it might be due
						to Django being more mature when it comes to documentation and code
						base. Or actually, it's because I never liked the 'g' object in
						Flask, does something equivalent exist in Django?</p>
						<p>As for DjangoGirls, the tutorial is really well made. I
						especially like the concept of showing the errors you encounter and
						then fixing said errors as a means of learning. Whether you are a
						total beginner or an experienced programmer I recommend that you
						try it out, it's fun! The extension lessons probably need a bit
						more work to reach the same quality as the main chapters, but I
						think they brought some really nice features to the blog, so do
						them as well.</p>
						<p>Finally, I'm sorry for the all too weird blog posts I made
						during this process. The things I'm capable of creating when I let
						my fantasy flow freely during hard time constraints are strange to
						say the least. But I do find the one about the weather quite
						charming, if you will.</p>

						<p>This weekend the weather has been great, I would call the
						weather Waffles because I like waffles.</p>
						<p>Earlier this week we had bad weather, mostly evil rain. I would
						call that weather Vader because it is evil.</p>
