          <h1>My Thoughts on Django and DjangoGirls</h1>
          <p>Having completed the DjangoGirls tutorial, including
          extenstions and more, I must say that I like it.<br>
          Granted, this blog only uses the most basic stuff and
          there's near endless potential for improvements. However,
          I feel that Django is logical and easy to work with. The
          way of putting together models, views, urls and templates
          and mixing it up with some Django fairydust is a most
          joyful experience. I've not worked with many web
          frameworks before but I do have some encounters with
          Flask and right now I think I prefer Django. I'm not sure
          why, and I'm much too inexperienced to have a say in the
          matter, but it might be due to Django being more mature
          when it comes to documentation and code base. Or
          actually, it's because I never liked the 'g' object in
          Flask, does something equivalent exist in Django?</p>
          <p>As for DjangoGirls, the tutorial is really well made.
          I especially like the concept of showing the errors you
          encounter and then fixing said errors as a means of
          learning. Whether you are a total beginner or an
          experienced programmer I recommend that you try it out,
          it's fun! The extension lessons probably need a bit more
          work to reach the same quality as the main chapters, but
          I think they brought some really nice features to the
          blog, so do them as well.</p>
          <p>Finally, I'm sorry for the all too weird blog posts I
          made during this process. The things I'm capable of
          creating when I let my fantasy flow freely during hard
          time constraints are strange to say the least. But I do
          find the one about the weather quite charming, if you
          will.</p>
